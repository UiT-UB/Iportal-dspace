<h2>Submission help - doctoral theses</h2>

<hr />
<a name="describe2"></a><h3>Submit: Describe your thesis</h3>
<hr />

<p>
<b>Conditions and limitations:</b>
</p>

<p>
Please provide the Munin manager with any information regarding inclusion of your thesis in Munin. For instance, this may be information stating that parts of your thesis should not be included in Munin, or should not be included in Munin until some future date. You may also post questions to the Munin manager, who then will contact you. 
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<b>Co-authors' consent:</b>
</p>

<p>
All co-authors must consent before a document (e.g. an article) is made public. It is therefore necessary to ask for this confirmation, in case your thesis has papers that may be included in Munin. For articles published with Creative Commons-license, which is often the case for Open Access-published articles, no co-author's consent is needed. 
</p>
<p>
If your thesis does not include any articles with co-authors, you chose the "not applicable"-option.
</p>
<p>
In the free text field named "More on consent", you may include more information on this, e.g. what remains to be done before all co-authors have consented. Here you also may post questions about this to the Munin manager, who will then contact you.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<b>Name of candidate:</b>
</p>

<p>
Your name is collected automatically from the student registry. If you find that it is misspelled, you may correct it.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<b>Title:</b>
</p>

<p>
Enter the full title of your thesis.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
</p>

<p>
Please enter (or paste) abstract(s) of your thesis, to be included in Munin together with your thesis. We recommend an abstract of 200-300 word. The abstract helps readers to quickly see what your thesis is about, and improves search and retrieval of your thesis. Click "Add More" to enter abstracts in more than one language. You may enter abstract(s) in as many languages as you prefer.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<b>Approved instruction component:</b>
</p>

<p>
Enter the reference from the ePhorte-archive where documentation of your approved instruction component is found.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<b>Subject categories/keywords:</b>
</p>

<p>
Please enter subject category/categories from the fixed vocabulary: Click "Subject categories", and click the plus sign in front of one of the main categories. Click your way down in the subject tree, and preferably choose a subject that does not have an adjacent plus sign. By clicking the text of your chosen subject category, this is automatically entered into the submission form. You may enter several subject categories from this fixed vocabulary by clicking "Add More".
</p>

<p>
In addition to subject categories from the fixed vocabulary, you may enter free text keywords which describe the content of your thesis. Good keywords improve the retrieval of your thesis. Enter one keyword only, or one phrase, per box. Click "Add More" to enter more keywords. 
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<b>Language:</b>
</p>

<p>
Choose the language in which the thesis is written. If the language is missing in the list, chose "(Other)".
</p>

<p>
Click "Next" to proceed. Or you may click "Cancel/Save", and save your submission. You may log in and continue later, and nothing of your entered information will be lost.

</p>

<p>

<hr />
<a name="license"></a><h3>Submit: License agreement</h3>
<hr />

<p>
If you want your thesis available in Munin, you need to accept the license agreement. Please read the license agreement closely. If you have any questions on this, please contact the <a href="http://www.ub.uit.no/wiki/openaccess/index.php/Kontakt_Munin">Munin repository manager</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you have chosen not to have your thesis included in Munin, you will not see any license agreement.
</p>

<hr />
<h3>Submit: Submission Complete</h3>
<hr />

<p>
As soon as your thesis is submitted, the administration at your faculty will forward it to the committee. Your thesis will be made available in Munin after it is approved for defence, with consideration, however, to the conditions and limitations you have outlined in the submission. As soon as the thesis is made available in Munin, a message will be sent to the same address this e-mail is sent to. If you have chosen not to have your thesis available in Munin, this will of course be respected.

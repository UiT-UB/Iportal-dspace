<p>
<b>On availability in Munin:</b>
</p>

<p>
Here you may give information if you want (parts of) your thesis not to be made openly available in Munin for a period. Be exact and explain which parts this applies to, and for how long. Be aware that the PhD regulations (Section 21 (5)) reads as follows:
</p>

<p>
<i>"Published parts of the thesis shall, as a main rule, be openly available either in open access journals or in UiT's access archive. Unpublished parts of the thesis shall be openly available no later than two years after the defence and unpublished monographs no later than four years after the defence. All parts of a thesis must be openly available no later than five years after the defence."</i>
</p>

<p>
Here you also may place questions on the issue of open access to your thesis, and those handling this will contact you.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<b>Name of candidate:</b>
</p>

<p>

<b>Abstract:</b>
</p>

<p>
Please enter (or paste) abstract(s) of your thesis, to be included in Munin together with your thesis. We recommend an abstract of 200-300 word. The abstract helps readers to quickly understand what your thesis is about, and it improves search and retrieval of your thesis. You must enter the abstract in both English and Norwegian. You may also enter abstracts in other languages.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<b>Approved instruction component:</b>
</p>

<p>
You may enter free text keywords which describe the content of your thesis. Good keywords improve the retrieval of your thesis. Enter one keyword only, or one phrase, per box. Click "Add More" to enter more keywords. 
</p>

<hr />

<p>
<b>Language:</b>
</p>

<p>

Your thesis will be made available in Munin after it is approved for defence, with consideration, however, to to any wishes you have expressed regarding delaying open access to (parts of) your thesis. As soon as the thesis is made available in Munin, a message will be sent to your UiT e-mail account.

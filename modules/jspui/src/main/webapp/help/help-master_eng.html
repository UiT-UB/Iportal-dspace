<hr />
<h3>Submit: Submission complete</h3>
<hr />

<p>

Your thesis will be made available in Munin after it is approved, unless you have stated otherwise in the submission process. As soon as the thesis is made available in Munin, a message will be sent to the same address this e-mail is sent to.
